# Query-To-Html-Tester
When you use any T-SQL query or function, you can use SSMS interactively, checking your results in the result pane. This is not the case when the result is in HTML and CSS. The result is better viewed in a browser. The QueryToHtmlTester tool makes this design process a great deal faster by allowing you to connect to the server, run the function and display it in a browser pane within the application.
